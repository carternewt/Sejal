# How to Download FASTQ files from SRA accessions
[srr_download.sh](https://github.com/carternewt/Sejal/blob/2967191a55a8ba6a40709fbdbd643761e0d1ac37/srr_download.sh) is a bash script that takes a list of SRA IDs, downloads the respective .sra file using `prefetch` from the [SRA-Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools) and then downloads the FASTQ files stored under each .sra file using `fasterq-dump` from the SRA-Toolkit. 

First, the `prefetch` command can iterate through a file of SRA accession ID's, such as the ones found in [Paenibacillus_SRR.txt](https://github.com/carternewt/Sejal/blob/f839db7d34b346563abdfe6d2a6e2bbc7194efb6/Paenibacillus_SRR.txt), and download the SRA file for each ID. We need this SRA file for `fasterq-dump`, since, for some reason, `fasterq-dump` generates errors when it tries to itterate through the SRA ID list itself. Thus, once all the SRA files are downlaoded via `prefetch` we can search for the .sra files in the directory we downloaded them into via `prefetch` and loop through each found instance by using the .sra file as the input for `fasterq-dump`. This will then download the respective FASTQ files for each SRA ID into another designated directory.
